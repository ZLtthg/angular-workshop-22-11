# Demo

This is a demo project for the angular workshop november 2022

## Development server

Run `npm api` to start the mock backend server.
Then run in a different terminal `ng serve` for a dev server.
Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
